Neutrino interaction cross section is one of the main sources of theoretical uncertainty in calculated count rates in detectors. For the accurate interpretation of the neutrino experiment results, in particular, for the of neutrino mixing parameter extraction, it is necessary to study this effect, especially, the uncertainty of nuclear models and model-dependent description of the vector and axial-vector form factorsand structure functions of the nucleon. In the structural functions of the cross sections of quasielastic scattering and resonant pion production reactions as parameters are the so-called axial masses, in the experimental knowledge of the values ​​of which there is no unity. There is currently no generally accepted single nuclear model, applicable to calculate the neutrino interaction cross sections in a wide energy range, from threshold to extremely high values. Phenomenological solution to both these problems is to apply the effective axial mass, which means the use of the relativistic Fermi gas model of the nucleus at the same time with the introduction of the parameterization of the axial form factor and allows consistently to describe the results of these and many other experiments on the quasi-elastic cross sections of the neutrino.
