\section{Methodology: Quasielastic neutrino-nucleus cross sections}
\subsection{The nuclear model problem}
Currently there is no generally accepted model for calculating neutrino-nucleus interaction cross sections, applicable in a wide energy range from threshold to ultrahigh values. The importance of the choice of nuclear physics model for neutrino oscillations is considered in the work by Meloni and Martini~\cite{Meloni:2012fq}, where the results of the experiment T2K~\cite{Abe:2011sj,Abe:2012gx} retrieves the value of the neutrino mixing parameters with using conventional Relativistic Fermi gas model (RFG), as well as MECM model~\cite{Martini:2009uj}. The most striking difference is observed for the angle $\theta_{13}$: $\sin^{2}2\theta_{13}^{\textrm{RFG}}=0.138^{+0.031}_{-0.041}$ is approximately 2 times bigger than $\sin^{2}2\theta_{13}^{\textrm{MECM}}=0.092^{+0.030}_{-0.052}$.

Figure~\ref{MiniBooNE} demonstrates that nuclear model of Martini~\textit{et al.} can describe MiniBooNE data~\cite{AguilarArevalo:2010zc} \textbf{with $M_A=1.03$\,GeV}~\cite{Martini:2011wp}. At high energies nuclear effects are less important that explains good agreement between experimental data and RFG model \textbf{with $M_A=1.012\pm{0.031}$\,GeV}~\cite{Kuzmin:2014}. Hydrogen and deuterium calculations don't use nuclear model at all and \textbf{gives us $M_A=1.026\pm{0.031}$\,GeV}~\cite{Kuzmin:2014}. $M_{A}$ extracted in both this cases are consistent with each other and with result of Martini~\textit{et al.}. K2K and T2K experiments that are not agree with $M_{A}\sim1$\,GeV, deal with lower neutrino energies too. The natural conclusion is that RFG model used for data processing in experiments does not work at low energies.

The problem is that there is no nuclear model which works properly for all energies. Therefore, even in case the correct value of the axial mass was known, using it with wrong nuclear model could not describe experimental data on quasielastic cross sections and would lead to errors in predictions.

\subsection{The effective axial mass approach}
Phenomenological solution of this problem is as follows. As we know, using RFG model with different values of $M_{A}$ can give a good description of experimental data obtained in different energy ranges. Thus, we propose to continue using this model but modify the axial form factor to compensate nuclear effects in the low-energy region. For this parametrization we need to introduce the variable effective axial mass as a function of neutrino energy and use it instead of conventional constant $M_{A}$. Of course, modified functions $F_{A}(M_{A}^\mathrm{eff})$, $F_{P}(M_{A}^\mathrm{eff})$ are no longer axial-vector and pseudoscalar form-factors.

The figure~\ref{MA_QES_eff} demonstrates how one can fit experimental data to get the $M_{A}^\mathrm{eff}$. We chose for parametrization a simple form:
\begin{equation}
M_{A}^\mathrm{eff}=M_{0}\left(1+\frac{E}{E_{0}}\right).
\end{equation}

%In this slide the total cross sections of the quasielastic scattering neutrino on hydrogen and carbon targets are shown. You can see that data obtained in experiments with almost free nucleons do not contradict with the best-fit constant $M_A$. But MiniBooNE and NOMAD datasets are not consistent in any constant $M_A$ hypothesis. On the contrary, applying the offered effective $M_A$ gives a good description of theese experiments. I would like you to pay attention on the fact that the energy range of NO$\nu$A experiment lays between their studied areas.
