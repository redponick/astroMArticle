\section{Results and discussion: The axial mass effect}
In contrast, we propose to call constant $M_{A}$ used in real form-factor $F_{A}$ ``current''. Figure~\ref{SKrates} displays the result of our calculation: ratios of the neutrino event rates caused by the QES interactions with hydrogen and oxygen nuclei in the Super-Kamiokande detector, evaluated with several values of current $M_{A}$ to ones computed with preliminary offered $M_{A}^{\mathrm{eff}}$. Figure~\ref{NOvArates} presents results for NO$\nu$A experiment in analogical way. It can be seen, that the adequate choice of the axial mass value is very important to the neutrino event rate calculations: error in count rates predicted with high-energy and hydrogen/deuterium data near NO$\nu$A energy maximum 2\,GeV achieves 6\%, using the MiniBooNE result $M_{A}=1.35$\,GeV~\cite{AguilarArevalo:2010zc} in high-entrgy region leads to approximately 30\% errors.
