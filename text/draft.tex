Currently there is no generally accepted model for calculating neutrino-nucleus interaction cross sections, applicable in a wide energy range from threshold to ultrahigh values. The importance of the choice of nuclear physics model for neutrino oscillations is considered in the work by Meloni and Martini~\cite{Meloni:2012fq}, where the results of the experiment T2K~\cite{Abe:2011sj,Abe:2012gx} retrieves the value of the neutrino mixing parameters with using conventional Fermi gas model, as well as MECM model~\cite{Martini:2009uj}. The most striking difference is observed for the angle $\theta_{13}$: $\sin^{2}2\theta_{13}^{\textrm{RFG}}=0.138^{+0.031}_{-0.041}$ is approximately 2 times bigger than $\sin^{2}2\theta_{13}^{\textrm{MECM}}=0.092^{+0.030}_{-0.052}$.
